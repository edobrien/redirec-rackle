                <p>This Privacy Notice details the types of personal data we may collect about you when you interact with us. It also explains how we will store and handle that data and keep it safe.</p>
                <p>Terms defined in our Website Terms & Conditions shall have the same meaning when set out here.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Notice, please do get in touch with us: <a href="mailto:theracklereports@gmail.com">theracklereports@gmail.com</a></p>

                <h2 class="pt-4 pb-2">1. What data do we collect and when?</h2>
                <p>We normally collect your data when you provide it to us.  You may give us your data by email, through an online web form, or by browsing our website.</p>
                <p>The type of data we collect depends on why we are processing your data. We typically collect your name, employer, position and contact details. We only use your data for the purposes for which it was provided. For instance: </p>
                <p class="font-bold">Marketing</p>
                <p>We use your data to send you emails and messages about new features, products and services, and content. Our mailing list includes contact information and is currently managed through MailChimp, for the purpose of sending newsletters about new information that can be found on the rackle, own events, podcasts, videos and other content. By requesting a report on our website, you will have opted into our mailing list, as providing reports and updated information about reports and upcoming reports is an intrinsic part of the service we provide.</p>
                <p>MailChimp is based in the US and therefore your data (name, contact details) is transferred outside of the EU. However, we believe that, given the limited nature of the data being transferred, the US-EU Privacy Shield provides adequate data security and protection.</p>
                <p>If you are no longer happy for us to contact you, at any time you can stop receiving emails from us by updating your mailing preferences or emailing us at <a href="mailto:theracklereports@gmail.com">theracklereports@gmail.com</a>.</p>
                <p class="font-bold">Visiting our website</p>
                <p>The rackle uses Google Analytics and cookies in order to analyse how the website is used and to improve our service and your user experience. Aside from the approximate location (IP address), the information collected by Google Analytics is mostly anonymous and relates to site traffic, including browser information, device information and language. We may also choose to introduce other commonly used analytics tools in the future, such as Hubspot.</p>
                <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of our website.</p>

                <h2 class="pt-4 pb-2">2. How do we protect your data?</h2>
                <p>We take protecting your data very seriously. Subject to the information on data sharing with third parties set out below, access to your personal data is password-protected and limited to the rackle only.</p>

                <h2 class="pt-4 pb-2">3. How long will we keep your data?</h2>
                <p>We only keep your data for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was provided. If you contact us to withdraw your consent to our processing of your data, we will delete your personal data.</p>

                <h2 class="pt-4 pb-2">4. Who do we share your personal data with?</h2>
                <p>We explained above how we sometimes share your data with third party data processors contracted to us, such as Mailchimp and/or Hubspot. This section addresses the circumstances under which we may share some of your personal data with other third parties, for example for our business development purposes or third parties who have produced reports that you have requested. </p>
                <p>If you request a report that has been authored by an individual outside of the rackle we will share your name, employer and contact details with the third party so that they can send you a copy of the report that you have requested.  We sometimes share your personal data with trusted third parties.  An example would be potential sponsors. Another example would include potential investors in the rackle.</p>

                <h2 class="pt-4 pb-2">5. What are your rights?</h2>
